    <h1>
        Movie API for the myFlix app
    </h1>

    <p>
        The goal is to build the server-side component of a movies web application. The
        web application will provide users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres.
        Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.
    </p>
